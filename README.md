# MCP Demo

Pull this project down with ``git clone`` to use the mcp_langchain.py file. 
This is a very simplified demo of how MCP works.

Once cloned, make sure to install the libraries ``pip install langchain-anthropic python-dotenv langgraph``
and then you can run the file as long as you have an API Key.

Remember MCP is for an LLM to decide which tool to use...
